            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 3rd version of the app is officially released. Using this app you are going to be able to turn in your assignments in no time.</p>
<p>In this update, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>added the new server names that are available on scylla.cs.uoi.gr server.</li>
<li>make use of the new command <code>rupt</code> instead of the old one <code>ruptime</code> which saves me time because all the servers that this command outputs are online.</li>
<li>created release files so that the app is easier to use on each system. For now, there are only releases for windows and debian systems as these are the systems that I created the app and tested it.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I also created an app for mac systems but it hasn't been tested yet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this process I am not alone. I have several friends that have helped me.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/IliasDimopoulos99" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ilias Dimopoulos</a></strong>, who helped me with the documentation, read it and told me what to fix.</li>
</ul>
