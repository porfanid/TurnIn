# SSH Security Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the security vulnerability where the TurnIn application used `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()` which automatically accepts any SSH host key, making users vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Secure Host Key Policy
- **Before**: `paramiko.AutoAddPolicy()` - accepts any host key automatically
- **After**: `SecureHostKeyPolicy()` - requires user verification with fingerprint display

### 2. Host Key Storage
- **Before**: Hardcoded SSH keys in `config.py`
- **After**: Uses system and user `known_hosts` files (`~/.ssh/known_hosts`)

### 3. User Verification Process
- **SHA256 fingerprint** (modern standard)
- **MD5 fingerprint** (legacy compatibility) 
- **Clear security warnings**
- **Accept/Reject dialog** with key persistence

### 4. Multi-Environment Support
- **GUI mode**: PyQt6 dialog with formatted warnings
- **Console mode**: Text-based prompts
- **Graceful fallbacks**: Handles missing GUI components

## Code Changes

### Main Implementation (`src/utils/ssh.py`)
```python
class SecureHostKeyPolicy(paramiko.MissingHostKeyPolicy):
    """Custom host key policy that prompts user for verification"""
    
def add_ssh_keys(ssh):
    """Load system and user known_hosts files with secure policy"""
    ssh.load_system_host_keys()
    ssh.load_host_keys(os.path.expanduser("~/.ssh/known_hosts"))
    ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(SecureHostKeyPolicy())
```

### Configuration (`src/config.py`)
- Marked `SSH_KEYS` as deprecated
- Kept for backward compatibility but no longer used

### Tests (`src/tests/test_ssh.py`)
- Updated all existing tests (12/12 passing)
- Added tests for secure policy behavior
- Added tests for fingerprint generation
- Added tests for known_hosts file handling

## Security Benefits

1. **Protection against MITM attacks**: Users must verify host keys
2. **Fingerprint verification**: Both SHA256 and MD5 for security validation
3. **Persistent security**: Accepted keys saved to standard locations
4. **User awareness**: Clear warnings about unknown hosts
5. **Standard compliance**: Uses SSH best practices

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- Main UI components use the new secure implementation
- API signatures unchanged
- Graceful handling of missing dependencies

## Testing

- ✅ 12/12 SSH unit tests passing
- ✅ Integration tests verify security improvements
- ✅ Main application components import successfully
- ✅ Both GUI and console modes tested

The implementation now follows SSH security best practices while maintaining the application's usability and functionality.
