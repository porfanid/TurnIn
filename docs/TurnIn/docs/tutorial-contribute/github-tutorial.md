# GitHub tutorial

In order for you to contribute to this code you need to know how to colaborate with other people using [GitHub](https://github.com), so if you do not have an account, I would suggest that you create one(You will need it anyway).

After that, I strongly recommend that you take a look at a [tutorial](https://github.com/porfanid/first-contributions) on how to contribute to a GitHub repository through pull requests. This will help you get started on using GitHub in a more professional way.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to change a single file and contribute to an other repository. You are going to do exactly the same with my repository.
