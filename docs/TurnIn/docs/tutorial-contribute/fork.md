# Fork the project

As, I said, you will follow that tutorial. What I want you to do is fork the project and create a custom branch(just as you did in the tutorial) and make your changes. Then, push them and create a pull request(just as you did in the tutorial).

As an extra step, create an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/porfanid/TurnIn/issues) specifying what the problem is and what you improved.
